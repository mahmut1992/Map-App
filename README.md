# 🗺️ Interactive Map Notes App

This repository presents an interactive map-based note-taking application developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to select any location on a map, mark that spot, and create custom notes for each point. These notes are displayed as popups directly on the map with their titles visible at a glance.

The app is particularly useful for planning **visits, meetings, or events**—letting users visually organize their locations with meaningful notes. To ensure persistence, all notes are stored in **localStorage**, so the data remains intact even after refreshing or closing the browser.

The map functionality is implemented using the **Leaflet** library, providing a smooth and responsive map interface.
